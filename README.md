**This is a small game i made, this is the classic hangman with a fun hangman display**

There is a simple game i made, you can play it in a shell, it has pre-built words that you have to guess to complete the game. It is fun and just a small light game you can run to play when bored. You can also change the words in the code to make the game more fun!
